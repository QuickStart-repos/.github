I create **ready-to-use template repositories** so you can quickly set up a project.  
The templates include common structures and files for different types of projects, so you don’t have to start from scratch.

- **Simple Setup:** Basic files and folder structure ready to go.  
- **Consistency:** Organized templates that are easy to use and maintain.

## Who This Is For

Developers who want to start new repositories quickly without setting up everything manually.

## How To Use

1. Browse the template repositories.  
2. Click **Use this template** on any repository to create your own copy.  
3. Add your project content and start coding.

## Reporting Issues or Requesting Templates

If you notice a problem with one of the template repositories or want to request a new template, you can do so in the `.github` repository:

1. Go to the `.github` repository: [https://github.com/QuickStart-repos/.github](https://github.com/QuickStart-repos/.github)  
2. Click **New Issue**.  
3. Choose the appropriate issue template:
   - **Request a New Template** – to suggest a new repository template.  
   - **Report a Problem** – to report an issue with an existing template.  
4. Fill out the template with the required information and submit your issue.  

This ensures your request or report is clear and easy to address.
